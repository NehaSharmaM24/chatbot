# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation Chatbot

This is an end-to-end project that uses a Bi-LSTM sentiment analyzer trained on a Twitter dataset to detect emotions and recommend songs from a tracks dataset based on user chat input.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
  ```

## Project Structure
- `train_model.py`: Trains the Bi-LSTM sentiment analysis model and saves it.
- `process_data.py`: Processes the `tracks.csv` file with the trained model and saves the results.
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for the chatbot UI and song recommendations.
- `twitter_dataset.csv`: Dataset for training the sentiment model (must be provided).
- `tracks.csv`: Dataset containing song information (must be provided).
- `sentiment_model.h5`: Saved model file (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `tokenizer.pkl`: Saved tokenizer file (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `processed_tracks.csv`: Processed tracks file (generated by `process_data.py`).

## Setup
1. Place `twitter_dataset.csv` and `tracks.csv` in the project directory. Ensure `twitter_dataset.csv` has columns `text` and `emotion` with emotions labeled as `neutral`, `happy`, `fear`, `angry`, `sad`.
2. Run the following commands in sequence:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   python process_data.py
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage
- Enter text in the chat area and click "Analyze Sentiment" to detect your emotion and get song recommendations.
- Use the dropdown to filter and view tracks by specific emotions.

## Notes
- Ensure all datasets are correctly formatted and placed in the project directory.
- The model training may take a few minutes depending on your hardware.
